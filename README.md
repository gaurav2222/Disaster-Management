## Project Idea

The technology follows prediction, propagation and evacuation as it's 3 important stages. These are discussed clearly in order below.

  The technology in this project is to predict mainly when an earthquake(which leads to tsunamis or landslides) or depression of air pressure(which leads to heavy cyclones) occurs through several real time monitoring methods and by analyzing the previous data available to us.
  
  Our team has understood that during the calmities there is practically no power supply and the time effectively available to us is low. So we'll use radio signals to transmit distress signals which doesn't uses significant amount of power and can be generated from anywhere and can transmit to long distances. Also, we will try to use social networking to create awareness of the situation.
  
  Finally by the help of google maps or other, we'll find the safe places nearby and send that information through radio signals and other information platforms for the people out there.
  
  This way we can save maximum people's life and after the human lives are saved or during the evacuation process, we would be able to safeguard valuable properties. Also this prevents havoc situation.
  
  Thankyou.
